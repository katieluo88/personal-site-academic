Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University, advised by Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger and Prof. Bharath Hariharan. My research interests mostly lies in machine learning and computer vision. I am fortunate to have been supported by a Cornell University Fellowship and an Nvidia Graduate Student Fellowship.

Before joining Cornell University, I had the pleasure of working on a variety of topics including applied machine learning, deep reinforcement learning, and applications of natural language processing.
